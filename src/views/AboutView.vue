            Gym'kini was inspired by my love for the Ocean and running at the beach and how sometimes in fact most times i want to freely run without limitations and most beach runners feel the same way. Its not just for beach runners its for anyone who loves working out whether at home or the beach . Gym'kini fits well on a sunny day at home nor in the ocean whilst surfing.
  
  
            Gym'Kini is gym wear in a swim suit designed for people who love working out and love and the ocean.
